I created this site to allow users to customize map in less than 5 minutes. This site allows users to embed the map to their websites.
Users can add markers, add pop-up for the markers, add title and description for the pop-ups.
The application generates a JSON file for the users to add in the same directory as their HTML files.
Users can easily modify the markers and other values by editing the JSON file.
