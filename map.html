        Some notes on this Web App.
        <p>
            I was working on building the website of Community Engagement Core 
            at the University of Cincinnati when I was given the task of embedding a map 
            to their website.
            I learned about OpenLayers which is an Open-Source JavaScript library and provides
            an api to build maps similar to Google Maps.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was working on the website, I was also on a constant lookout for an apartment. 
            I would visit websites like apartments.com everyday. I was very fsacinated by their website 
            where multiple homes along with their description were displayed on the map.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just then, I had the idea to create a web app of my own, where the users can generate a map 
            of their own in just a few easy steps. There are multiple things I will be updating to this application 
            in the future updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of things I have planned for future updates:
            <ol>
                <li>Create an API to allow users to add the generated map quickly to their site</li>
                <li>Allow users to edit the initial ViewPort Coordinates once it has been set successfully</li>
                
            </ol>
        </p>
